    <h1>Chettinad Chenna Masala (Chick Peas Gravy)</h1>
    <p>Give this chana masala dish a try and don't look back. Indian food is not just curried sauces. This spin on an <br>Indian chickpea curry features a healthy mixture of chickpeas, tomatoes, onion, and spices. Both carnivores <br>and vegetarians will enjoy this meal. My kids love it. Leave out the green chile if the kiddies will be eating. <br>Serve over basmati or jasmine rice and enjoy. Namaste y'all!</p>

    <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

Season the mixture with chili powder, coriander, gram masala, turmeric, and salt; <br>cook and stir until very hot, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
